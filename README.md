# **US Civics Test Preparation Web App**

This web application helps users prepare for the U.S. Civics test by providing study materials, practice tests, and external resources. It is a full-stack web app developed using Flask for the backend and React for the frontend, with PostgreSQL as the database. The app supports user registration, login, and tracking of test scores.

- **Flashcards:** Users can review questions interactively with flashcards, flipping through and studying questions and answers.
- **Score History:** Logged-in users can view their practice test scores on the dashboard.
- **Resources:** Links to external materials for U.S. Civics test preparation.

## **Technologies Used**

### Backend:
- **Flask (Python):** For handling HTTP requests, managing user sessions, and backend logic.
- **SQLAlchemy:** For interacting with the PostgreSQL database.
- **PostgreSQL:** Database for storing user information, scores, questions, and test results.

### Frontend:
- **React:** For building the user interface with functional components.
- **React Router:** For handling navigation between different parts of the app.
- **JavaScript (ES6+):** For client-side logic.
- **HTML/CSS:** For structuring and styling the web pages.

### Database Models:
- **User:** Stores user data (username, email, password).
- **Score:** Tracks user scores for each practice test.
- **QuestionAnswer:** Stores test questions, their correct answers, and possible options.
- **TestResult:** Tracks whether a user’s answer to a question was correct.
